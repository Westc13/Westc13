### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Westc13/Westc13** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I am Chris, a web developer passionate about learning new technologies and delivering the optimal user experiences.

I knew nothing about web development before I joined Juno in April this year. Now look at how far I came along. To find out more about my journey and expanding skills, please check out my portfolio at https://chriswestcodewrangler.com.

While in Juno College of Technology learning web development, I discovered that I excelled in pair programming and group projects. Not only my end products are stellar, but also the experience itself, may it be working in pair or in groups, was stimulating and fun filled, even the challenges along the way.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with several of my Juno classmates on a few projects that are in high demand from the industry, such as an e-commerce web application, a simulation of instagram site and more...
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my skills in React, Angular and Vue, as well as dabbling in some back-end skills(Python, Mongo).

âš¡ Fun fact about me: I have two rescue dogs and I love spoiling them. I also love cheesy cinema (any movie franchise with sequel 3 or higher) and Friday nights are usually cheesy movie nights.
